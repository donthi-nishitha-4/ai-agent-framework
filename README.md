# 🚀 AI Agent Framework

## Built under the Intel Unnati Industrial Training Program

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **modular AI Agent Framework** that demonstrates how an AI agent can:

- 🧠 Analyze user tasks  
- 🧩 Break tasks into logical steps  
- 🔍 Reason step by step  
- 🛠️ Use tools when required  
- 🗂️ Maintain memory for context  
- 📤 Generate structured and meaningful outputs  

The emphasis is on **system design and explainable AI agent workflows**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✔️ Design a clean and modular AI agent architecture  
- ✔️ Understand task analysis and planning workflows  
- ✔️ Implement step-by-step reasoning logic  
- ✔️ Enable tool usage inside the agent pipeline  
- ✔️ Manage memory for contextual awareness  
- ✔️ Build an extensible and industry-aligned framework  

## 🧠 What is an AI Agent?

An AI agent is a system that can:

- 📥 Accept user input  
- 🔎 Understand and analyze the task  
- 🧩 Split the task into smaller steps  
- 🧠 Reason through each step logically  
- 🛠️ Use tools when needed  
- 🗂️ Store and recall memory  
- 📤 Produce meaningful and structured output
